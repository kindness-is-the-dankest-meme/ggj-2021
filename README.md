## Notes

The theme is [Lost & Found](https://globalgamejam.org/news/theme-global-game-jam-online-2021). There are some [diversifiers](https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj-online-diversifiers). Of particular interest to me are:

> #### Sponsored
>
> **Virtual Wallet (Sponsored by IGDA Foundation)** - Use the [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started/) to make a web game that uses an alternative revenue model ([learn how to do this here](https://igdafoundation.org/ggj2021/)).
>
> **Unlikely Allies (Sponsored by [Virtuos](https://www.virtuosgames.com/))** - Your game must support multiplayer crossplay between Mobile and PC.
>
> **The Feels (Sponsored by Sony Interactive Entertainment)** - We would like to encourage projects to come up with designs that take advantage of controller feel, game feel, and/or an emotional and honest personal story.
>
> #### Accessibility
>
> **Kitchen sink** - Players have a choice between at least three different types of input device (e.g. keyboard, controller, mouse, eye tracking, potatoes)
>
> #### Meta
>
> **Snail's Pace** - Your game is designed to be played over multiple days and cannot be sped up.

I'm participating through the [Houston Jam Site](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/houston-global-game-jam-2021) because I'm geographically there. But of course it's all online, so really just hanging out in the Discord.
